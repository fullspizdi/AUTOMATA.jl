# Welcome to AUTOMATA.jl

Explore the dynamics of emergent complexity with AUTOMATA.jl, a Julia package designed for simulating and analyzing cellular automata and other self-generating systems. Dive into a world where simple rules give rise to fascinating patterns and behaviors.

## Features

AUTOMATA.jl offers a robust set of features for researchers, artists, and anyone interested in complex systems:

- **Flexible Cellular Automata**: Easily define cellular automata with custom dimensions, neighborhoods, and rules.
- **Versatile Modeling Tools**: Extend beyond traditional cellular automata with tools for agent-based models and reaction-diffusion systems.
- **High-Performance Simulation**: Designed for efficiency, allowing for the exploration of complex systems on a large scale.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Create compelling visualizations and animations to better understand and present your findings.
- **Detailed Quantitative Analysis**: Measure and analyze patterns using entropy calculations, complexity metrics, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with AUTOMATA.jl, you will need to install the package and set up a basic simulation. Hereâ€™s how you can begin:

### Installation

Install AUTOMATA.jl using Julia's package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("AUTOMATA")
```

### Quick Example

Here's a quick example to demonstrate setting up and running a simple 1D cellular automaton:

```julia
using AUTOMATA

# Define a simple 1D cellular automaton
rule = WolframRule(30)
initial_state = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
ca = CellularAutomaton(rule, initial_state)

# Simulate for 20 steps and visualize the result
simulate(ca, 20)
plot(ca)
```
